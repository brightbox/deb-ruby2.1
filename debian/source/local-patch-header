This patch file represents the entire difference between the package as shipped
by Debian and the official upstream sources. The goal is to maintain this file
as small as possible, avoiding non-upstreamed patches at all costs.

The Debian packaging is maintained in the following Git repository:

  http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=collab-maint/ruby.git

To obtain a view of the individual commits that affect non-Debian-specific
files, you can clone that repository, and from the master branch, run:

  $ ./debian/upstream-changes
