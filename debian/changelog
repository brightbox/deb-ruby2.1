  * New upstream release
    + Includes a fix for override of existing LDFLAGS when building compiled
      extensions that use pkg-config (Closes: #721799).

      `debian/rules clean` to make them match the orig tarball and avoid
      spurious diffs.
    + This also lets us drop the diffs against generated files such as
      tool/config.* and configure.
    + documented in debian/README.source
  * debian/libruby2.0.symbols: refreshed with 2 new symbols added since last
    version.
