ruby2.1 (2.1.2-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Antonio Terceiro ]
  * Move libjs-jquery dependency from libruby2.1 to ruby2.1, and turn it into
    Recommends:. This way programs that link against libruby2.1 won't pull in
    libjs-jquery; OTOH those using rdoc (and thus needing libjs-jquery) would
    be already using ruby2.1 anyway.

  [ Christian Hofstaedtler ]
  * Update Vcs-Git URL, as we've moved from master2.1 to master.
  * Prepare libruby21.symbols for x32 (Closes: #759615)
  * Remove embedded copies of SSL certificates. Rubygems is advised by
    rubygems-integration to use the ca-certificates provided certificates.
    (Closes: #689074)

ruby2.0 (2.0.0.299-2) unstable; urgency=low

      spurious diffs.
    + This also lets us drop the diffs against generated files such as
      tool/config.* and configure.
    + documented in debian/README.source
  * debian/libruby2.0.symbols: refreshed with 2 new symbols added since last
    version.
